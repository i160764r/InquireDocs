# InquireDocs — RAG-Based Domain-Specific Q&A System

![Project Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)  
---

## 🚀 Project Overview

InquireDocs is an AI-powered Question & Answer system that allows users to upload domain-specific documents (PDFs, TXT, etc.) and ask natural language questions about the content. It combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)techniques using OpenAI’s language models with a vector database (FAISS) for efficient semantic search.

## ✨ Features

- Upload your own documents (PDF)  
- Automatically chunk and embed document text for fast retrieval  
- Ask questions in natural language related to your documents  
- Get precise, context-aware answers generated by GPT  
- View source document snippets that support answers  
- Simple, clean UI built with Streamlit

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/i160764r/InquireDocs.git
   cd InquireDocs

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"  # Windows PowerShell: $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
5. Run the app:
    streamlit run app.py


## 🖥️ Usage
Open the web app in your browser (usually http://localhost:8501)

Upload a document (PDF)

Enter your question in the input box

Submit and receive answers with supporting document snippets

🎯 How It Works
Document Upload & Processing:
The uploaded file is split into manageable chunks using text splitters.

Embedding & Indexing:
Each chunk is converted to a vector embedding and stored in FAISS for fast similarity search.

Query Handling:
When you ask a question, your query is also embedded and compared against the stored vectors to find relevant chunks.

Answer Generation:
The relevant chunks are fed into GPT-4 with a prompt to generate a concise and accurate answer.
